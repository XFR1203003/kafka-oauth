# KeyCloak Setup

- Download version 6.01 of KeyCloak Standalone Server from the following:
    - https://www.keycloak.org/downloads.html
    - Unzip to a preferred file location
    - Run the standalone file to start KeyCloak
        - If you wish to learn more about the KeyCloak configuration follow this link:
        - https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_installation/index.html#_standalone-mode
    
   ![image info](pictures/KeyCloak/standalone-boot-files.png)


- Navigate to your running KeyCloak instance:
    - http://localhost:8080

## Create Admin User
- The first time you navigate to the administration console you have to create administrator user. 
- Create an admin user, and login into the administration console.

## Create Client Scopes
- Create the KeyCloak client scopes that represent topics and kafka brokers that need to be secured.
- Client scopes are defined using the Uniform Resource Name (URN) format.

        urn:kafka:{resourceType}:{resourceName}:{operation}

 * resourceType: topic, group, cluster
 * resourceName: The name of the resource (topic name, group name, cluster name). 
 * operation: read, write, create, delete, alter, describe, cluster_action

- Please see Kafka documentation for valid combinations of resource types to operations.
    - [List of Kafka Operations and Resource Types](https://docs.confluent.io/current/kafka/authorization.html#acl-format)

##### For this example we will be using a topic called "test" and a consumer group called "foo".


#### Kafka Broker Client Scopes
- To allow the broker to be authorized the following scopes need to be created.

        urn:kafka:cluster:kafka-cluster:cluster_action

#### Kafka Producer Client Scopes
- Producers will need to be able to write and describe on a topic. 

        urn:kafka:topic:test:describe
        urn:kafka:topic:test:write 

#### Kafka Consumer Client Scopes 
- Consumers will need to be able to read and describe both a group and a topic.

        urn:kafka:topic:test:describe
        urn:kafka:topic:test:read 
        urn:kafka:group:foo:describe
        urn:kafka:group:foo:read

##### Create the Scopes in KeyCloak
- To create a Client Scope navigate to the Client Scopes tab in the left menu.
- Click create on the upper left hand corner of the table
- Complete the form with the valid URN scope formatted name


For Example:

## Create Kafka Broker Client
- Create a "kafka-broker" client that represents the Kafka application that needs to perform cluster operations.
- Make sure to enable the service account feature, this will allow the client to be authenticated and authorized in Kakfa.

For Example:

 ![image info](pictures/KeyCloak/TestBroker.png) 

#### Grant Kafka Broker Client Scopes
- Assign the broker scope specified above to the "kafka-broker" client

For Example:

  ![image info](pictures/KeyCloak/TestBroker-ClientScopes.png)


## Create Test Producer Client
- Create a "test-producer" client that represents the Kafka application that needs to perform read/describe operations.
- Make sure to enable the service account feature, this will allow the client to be authenticated and authorized in Kakfa.

For Example:

 ![image info](pictures/KeyCloak/TestProducer.png) 

#### Grant Test Producer Client Scopes
- Assign the producer scopes specified above to the "test-producer" client

For Example:

  ![image info](pictures/KeyCloak/TestProducer-ClientScopes.png)


## Create Test Consumer Client
- Create a "test-consumer" client that represents the Consumer application that needs to perform write/describe operations.
- Make sure to enable the service account feature, this will allow the client to be authenticated and authorized in Kakfa.

For Example:

 ![image info](pictures/KeyCloak/TestConsumer.png) 

#### Grant Test Consumer Client Scopes
- Assign the consumer scopes specified above to the "test-consumer" client

For Example:

  ![image info](pictures/KeyCloak/TestConsumer-ClientScopes.png)
    
## Optional - Create Admin Client
- This is an admin service account to use from the CLI.
- The customized CLI will interact with the KeyCloak API to create a scope and add it to a specified client.
    - To be able to interact with the KeyCloak API an admin client is required.
- Create a new client called "kafka-admin"

For Example:

 ![image info](pictures/KeyCloak/AdminClient.png) 

#### Assign Service Account Roles
- Add realm management roles
